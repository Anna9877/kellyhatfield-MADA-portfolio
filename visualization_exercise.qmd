# Inspiration

For inspiration I chose this chart on fivethirtyeight

![](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FUTURE-OF-WORK-3@2x.png){alt="" width="408"}

I accessed it from this [website here.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-post-pandemic-offices-could-be-whiter-and-more-male/)

## Loading the data

I manually typed the data into a csv file. First, we'll load the data and some packages

```{r}

library(readr)
Visualization_Data <- read_csv("Visualization Data.csv")


library(tidyverse)
library(scales)

view(Visualization_Data)

```

## Creating horizontal bar chart

```{r}

view(Visualization_Data)

p<-ggplot(data=Visualization_Data, aes(x=reorder(Gender, Percent), y=Percent, fill=Response)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + coord_flip() +facet_grid(Question ~ .) +
  labs(title="Parents feel more productive and focused at home", subtitle="Share of global knowledge workers with children who said \n various aspects of their work were better or worse \n when working remotely or in-office, by gender.", 
caption="Based on a survey of 10,420 respondents classified as 'knowledge workers' - or anyone who \n handles information for a living- and who work full-time, \n between April 26, and May 6, 2021.") 
p                        



```

##Lets change the colors and resort the data to fix.

```{r}


#Lets add the caption 
library(shadowtext)


p2 <- p + geom_shadowtext(data=subset(Visualization_Data, Response=="Same" & Gender=="Male" & Question=="Ability to focus on work"),aes(y = Percent, x = Gender, label="No Change"), hjust=0, nudge_x=0.1,color="black",bg.colour="white", size=3) +   scale_fill_manual(values=c("orchid3",
                             "white",
                             "darkgreen")) + theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.title.y=element_blank(), plot.title=element_text(hjust=-0.2), plot.caption=element_text(hjust = 0.2), axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank())


p2


```


##Not bad...


Getting there. Still more to do! How to get those pesky titles on top??
